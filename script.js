/* 
1. Issues in the Original Code:

*Assignment Instead of Comparison: In the original code, you used = for comparisons instead of ===. 
The = operator is used for assignment, not for comparison. 
This caused conditions to always evaluate to true and execute the associated blocks of code.

*Incorrect Count Increment: The original code had the count increment statements (let count = count + ...) inside the code blocks, 
resulting in re-declaration of the count variable within those blocks. This prevented the correct counting of holidays.

*Incorrect Variable Name: The original code mixed up the variable names, 
using both date and count in ways that made it hard to keep track of the logic.

2. Changes Made to Achieve Intended Behavior:

*Changed the incorrect variable assignments to proper comparison operators (= to ===).
*Moved the count increment statements outside the condition blocks to correctly accumulate the count.
*Used consistent variable names (year instead of date) for clarity.
*Fixed syntax errors, including missing parentheses and semicolons.

3. Result of the Changes:

*By correcting the issues mentioned above, the modified code properly checks the conditions, 
increments the count of holidays, and logs the correct messages. 

*Moving the count increment statements outside the condition blocks ensures that the count is accurately updated 
regardless of whether the conditions are met.

4. Alternative Solutions:

One approach could involve using an array to store holiday information and associated logic. 
Another approach could use switch statements for better organization and readability. 
However, the key principles remain the same: correct comparison operators, proper variable handling, and accurate count updates.
